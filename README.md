This project demonstrates a simple neural network designed to predict and learn the boolean outcome of XOR expressions (0 and 1). XOR is a great example to apply machine learning to because it is not able to be solved with straightforward coding solutions, (linearly separable), making it a common
demonstration around the world to understand how neural networks function.
<br/> 
The network takes binary inputs representing these XOR expressions and changes its weights and biases on each iteration of the training loop to improve its predictions. Around 10,000 training iterations, it can predict correct output with 97% accuracy.
- Great for visualization, you can track how the network improves
- Outlines important NN concepts, forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updating.
- No high-level ML libraries are needed, only simple numpy! (No Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc.)
- Simple demonstration, great for learning how these interesting networks solve non-linear problems.
